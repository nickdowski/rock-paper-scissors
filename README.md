# Rock Paper Scissors Game

## Overview
This is a simple **Rock Paper Scissors** game implemented in JavaScript. The game is played through the browser using prompts and alerts. The player selects rock, paper, or scissors, and the computer randomly selects its choice. The game determines the winner and keeps track of scores.

## How It Works
1. The player is prompted to enter rock, paper, or scissors.
2. The computer randomly selects one of the three choices.
3. The game compares the player's choice with the computer's choice.
4. The winner is decided based on the standard Rock Paper Scissors rules:
   - Rock beats Scissors
   - Scissors beats Paper
   - Paper beats Rock
5. The winner's score is updated.
6. The game continues for 5 rounds using the `playGame` function, which calls `playRound` 5 times.
7. The final score is displayed at the end.
1. The player is prompted to enter **rock, paper, or scissors**.
