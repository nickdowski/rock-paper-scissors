# Rock Paper Scissors Game

## Overview
This is a simple **Rock Paper Scissors** game implemented in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game is played entirely in the browser with a graphical interface using buttons instead of prompts. The player selects rock, paper, or scissors by clicking a button, and the computer randomly chooses its move. The game then determines a winner and updates the score. The first to 5 points wins.

## How It Works
1. The player clicks one of the three buttons: **Rock**, **Paper**, or **Scissors**.
2. The computer randomly selects one of the three options.
3. The game compares the player's choice with the computer's.
4. The winner is decided based on the standard Rock Paper Scissors rules:
   - Rock beats Scissors
   - Scissors beats Paper
   - Paper beats Rock
5. The winnerâ€™s score is incremented.
6. Scores are displayed on the page.
7. Once either player reaches 5 points, a winner is announced and the buttons are disabled.

## Files
- **index.html** â€“ The structure of the webpage (includes scoreboard, buttons, and winner announcement area).
- **script.js** â€“ JavaScript file containing game logic, score tracking, button creation, and DOM manipulation.
