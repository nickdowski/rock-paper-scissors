Rock Paper Scissors Game

Overview

This is a simple Rock Paper Scissors game implemented in JavaScript. The game is played through the browser using prompts and alerts. The player selects rock, paper, or scissors, and the computer randomly selects its choice. The game determines the winner and keeps track of scores.

How It Works

The player is prompted to enter rock, paper, or scissors.

The computer randomly selects one of the three choices.

The game compares the player's choice with the computer's choice.

The winner is decided based on the standard Rock Paper Scissors rules:

Rock beats Scissors

Scissors beats Paper

Paper beats Rock

The winner's score is updated.

The game continues until one of the players reaches 5 wins (this can be modified later).
